			</p>
			<p class="help-answer-para">
				<span class="help-qa-letter">A:</span> Select Admin at the top of the page. This will take you to the Admin Dashboard.
				You’ll usually start from here. There are three “things” in GeoGem: Students, Teachers, and Squares.
				From the Admin Dashboard, you’ll define your school by creating and editing your Students, Teachers, and Squares.

			<p class="help-answer-para">
				<span class="help-qa-letter">A:</span> There is no way to completely remove a Teacher (or Student or Square) from GeoGem.

			</p>
			<p class="help-answer-para">
				<span class="help-qa-letter">A. Good point! While you can’t remove the teacher (and the session data associated with that teacher),
				you CAN suspend the login for any teacher. Here are the steps: 
									<ol type="1">
			  <li>Goto the Admin Dashboard,</li>
			  <li>Select All Teachers,</li>
			  <li>Select the teacher,</li>
			  <li>Select the Login Setting action icon at the bottom,</li>
			  <li>Set Login Status to “Suspended” and then “Change Settings”. </li>
			</ol> 
			<span class="help-qa-letter">After this, your suspended teacher will not be able to login to GeoGem.

				<span class="help-qa-letter">Q13.</span>I created a teacher and some students. But now, that teacher can’t
				access any of the students. What can I do? 
			</p>
			<p class="help-answer-para">
				<span class="help-qa-letter">A:</span> From the Admin Dashboard, select All Teachers. From there, select 
				the teacher you want to change. At the bottom of that teacher’s profile page, select the Student Roster icon.
				That page will allow you to add or remove students from a teacher’s roster.
			</p>
			<hr class="help-line">
			 <p>
				<span class="help-qa-letter">Q14.</span> So, teachers can only access students in their roster.
				Ok. As an Admin, which students can I access?
			</p>
			<p class="help-answer-para">
				<span class="help-qa-letter">A:</span>Correct. Teachers can only access students in their roster.
				These students are assigned by you, the Admin. Second, an Admin can always access any student in the school.
			</p>
			<hr class="help-line">
			 <p>
				<span class="help-qa-letter">Q15.</span> One of my teachers forgot his GeoGem password. How can I fix this problem?
			</p>
			<p class="help-answer-para">
				<span class="help-qa-letter">A:</span>Here’s the sequence: Goto the Admin Dashboard; Select All Teachers;
				Select the teacher you want; Select the Login Settings action icon at the bottom of the page. From there,
				you can reset a teacher’s password. Also in Login Settings, you can change a teacher’s powers
				(Admin, Teacher, or SessionOnly), or even suspend a teacher’s login.
			</p>
			<hr class="help-line">
			 <p>
				<span class="help-qa-letter">Q16.</span> What are the differences between the three Teacher “powers” settings?
			</p>
			<p class="help-answer-para">
				<span class="help-qa-letter">A:</span> There are three power levels for teachers (from strongest to weakest):
				Admin, Teacher, and SessionOnly. An Admin can create and edit nearly everything for their school in GeoGem.
				This is the person in charge. Teacher powers include running behavioral sessions and also analyzing the results.
				SessionOnly users can only run behavioral sessions and not analysis reports. The intent is that aides or volunteers
				would be candidates for SessionOnly status.
			</p>
			<hr class="help-line">
			 <p>
				<span class="help-qa-letter">Q17.</span> I see how I can change the password of other teachers, but as an Admin,
				how do I change my own password? And my gosh… what if I forget MY password? What then?
			</p>
			<p class="help-answer-para">
				<span class="help-qa-letter">A:</span> Select Profile in the navbar at the top of the page. That will take you to
				your Profile Page. At the bottom, you’ll see the Change Password action icon. Go there to change your own password. 
				If you forget your password and there isn’t another Admin in your school, then you need to contact GeoGem’s Super User for help.
				The best course is to email Prof Bill at
				<a href="mailto:wtkrieger@noctrl.edu">wtkrieger@noctrl.edu</a>.
